# Computer Security Laboratory Project

This repository contains the solutions for two laboratory exercises in computer
security, focusing on symmetric cryptography, password management, and authentication
vulnerabilities.

## Laboratory Exercise 1: Symmetric Cryptography and Password Manager

### Overview

User passwords are often the weakest point in system security. In this exercise, the goal
is to design and implement a simple and secure prototype of a password manager using
symmetric cryptography. This tool aims to securely store user passwords, alleviating
the need for users to remember unique passwords for various services.

### Features

- **Symmetric Cryptography:** Implement secure storage of passwords using symmetric encryption techniques.
- **Password Manager Prototype:** Develop a tool that allows users to store and manage their passwords securely.

## Laboratory exercise 2: Password autentication

### Overview
Passwords are a common method of authentication, but they come with vulnerabilities.
In this exercise, the focus is on implementing a secure login application, addressing
threats and vulnerabilities associated with passwords.

### Features

- **Secure Authentication:** Implement a login application with a focus on addressing common threats and vulnerabilities associated with passwords.
- **Administrative Tool:** Develop a tool for administrators to manage passwords and usernames securely.
- **User Login Tool:** Create a user-facing tool for secure login.
